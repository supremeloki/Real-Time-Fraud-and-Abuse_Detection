## Contributing Guidelines

### Branch Naming
- `feature/feature-name`: For new features
- `bugfix/bug-description`: For bug fixes
- `hotfix/critical-fix`: For critical fixes
- `docs/documentation-update`: For documentation changes

### Commit Messages
Follow conventional commit format:
```
type(scope): description

[optional body]

[optional footer]
```

Types:
- `feat`: New feature
- `fix`: Bug fix
- `docs`: Documentation
- `style`: Code style changes

- All critical paths must be tested
- Include integration tests for key workflows

### Running Tests
```bash
# Unit tests
pytest tests/ -v

# Integration tests
pytest tests/ -m integration

# With coverage
pytest tests/ --cov=src --cov-report=xml --cov-fail-under=80
```

### Writing Tests
- Use pytest framework
- Place test files in `tests/` directory
- Use descriptive test names
- Use fixtures for test setup

## Pull Request Process
