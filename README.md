## 🚀 5. Getting Started

⚡ Get the SnappTech Fraud Detection system up and running in minutes! Let's get you started! 🚀

### 📋 Prerequisites
*   **🐍 Python 3.8+** - The core language powering our ML pipelines
*   **🐳 Docker** - For containerization and isolated environments
*   **☸️ kubectl** - Kubernetes CLI for cluster management
*   **☸️ Kubernetes cluster** - Minikube/kind for local dev or cloud-managed for production
*   **⚓ Helm** - For infrastructure deployment and package management

### ⬇️ Installation
1.  **📥 Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/supremeloki/Real-Time-Fraud-and-Abuse_Detection.git
    cd Real-Time-Fraud-and-Abuse_Detection
    ```
2.  **📦 Install Python dependencies:**
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
    > 💡 **Pro tip:** Use a virtual environment to keep dependencies isolated!

### ⚙️ Configuration

🔧 All system configurations, model parameters, and environment-specific settings are managed in the `conf/` directory.

*   **`conf/fraud_model_params.yaml`**: Defines hyperparameters for various ML models.
*   **`conf/threshold_settings.yaml`**: Configures fraud detection thresholds, potentially adaptive.
*   **`conf/environments/dev.yaml`**: Development environment specific settings.
*   **`conf/environments/prod.yaml`**: Production environment specific settings.

🔒 Ensure these files are updated according to your deployment needs. Sensitive information (e.g., API keys, database credentials) should be handled via Kubernetes secrets, as defined in `k8s_secrets_config.yaml`.

### 💻 Local Development Setup (using Docker Compose for dependencies)

🛠️ For local development and testing, you might use Docker Compose to spin up Kafka, Redis, and MLflow.

1.  **🏗️ Build Docker images for services:**
    ```bash
    docker build -f deployment_ops/docker/Dockerfile.feature_processing -t snapptech/feature-processing:latest .
    docker build -f deployment_ops/docker/Dockerfile.inference_service -t snapptech/inference-service:latest .
    # (Repeat for other service Dockerfiles)
    ```
2.  **🚀 Run core services locally (example with Kafka/Redis via Docker Compose, assuming a `docker-compose.yaml` exists for these):**
    ```bash
    # Example: docker-compose up -d kafka redis mlflow
    # Then, run individual Python services directly or via Docker
    python src/ingestion_stream/kafka_event_consumer.py
    python src/prediction_engine/fraud_detection_api.py
    ```

### ☸️ Kubernetes Deployment

🚀 For a full-scale deployment, Kubernetes is used to manage all microservices.

1.  **🏗️ Set up Core Infrastructure (Kafka, Redis, MLflow, Prometheus/Grafana):**
    Use the provided Kubernetes YAML files in `deployment_ops/kubernetes/` or Helm charts for these components.
    ```bash
    kubectl apply -f deployment_ops/kubernetes/k8s_kafka_setup.yaml
    kubectl apply -f deployment_ops/kubernetes/k8s_redis_setup.yaml
    kubectl apply -f deployment_ops/kubernetes/k8s_mlflow_setup.yaml
    kubectl apply -f deployment_ops/kubernetes/k8s_grafana_prometheus_setup.yaml
    kubectl apply -f deployment_ops/kubernetes/k8s_api_gateway.yaml
    kubectl apply -f deployment_ops/kubernetes/k8s_schema_registry_setup.yaml
    kubectl apply -f deployment_ops/kubernetes/k8s_secrets_config.yaml # Ensure secrets are properly configured
    ```
2.  **🚀 Deploy Feature Processing and Fraud Detection Services:**
    ```bash
    kubectl apply -f deployment_ops/kubernetes/k8s_feature_processing_deployment.yaml
    kubectl apply -f deployment_ops/kubernetes/k8s_fraud_deployment.yaml
    kubectl apply -f deployments/kubernetes/k8s_model_deployment.yaml
    ```
3.  **📊 Monitor Deployment:**
    Check the status of your pods and services:
    ```bash
    kubectl get pods -n <your-namespace>
    kubectl get services -n <your-namespace>
    ```
